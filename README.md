# React Task Tracker

This was a simple React crash course from Brad Traversy that I followed and I learned a lot of the basics of React, including how to set up a development environment with create-react-app, how to create functional and class-based components, how to use JSX to render content to the DOM, and how to manage state using useState and props. I also made a mock back-end, so the project is a full-stack development project. Overall, the crash course was a great introduction to React and gave me a solid foundation to build upon.
